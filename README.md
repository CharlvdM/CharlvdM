Hey, I'm @CharlvdM

I'm an electronic engineer working in the Research and Development group of Transnet in South Africa. I mainly work on firmware for locomotive control systems. I am doing post-grad with the control systems research group of the University of Pretoria. My research is focussed on locomotive adhesion force estimation for slip control.
